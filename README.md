StatsParser
=========

This program searches .sts files for certain data and dumps the results of all the files it scans into a preformated file.

TODO
----
- ~~Read in 1 file correctly.~~
- ~~Read in recursively.~~
- ~~Configure gui.~~
- ~~Allow automatic output to master file/copy output to clipboard.~~

FINISHED WOOT.

How to Use
----
1. Open the jar file you download from [here](http://ci.myuplay.com/job/StatsParser/).
2. Press `Open`
3. Select the file(s), or folder(s) that you want it to parse. If its a folder, it will include all subdirectories and find all sts files.
4. Press `Parse`
5. Your clipboard has been loaded with the results. You can now paste them into your master coding sheet. To paste, click the top left cell of the data and press `ctrl + v`.

Notes: It is suggested to parse one map at a time. This parser does not seperate them and only reads data within the sts files. This way you can control where each maps data goes.
